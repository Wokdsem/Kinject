### Introduction
If you donÂ´t know why dependency injection? You can first start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). 

* ***Why Kinject?***

  Dependency injection frameworks are nothing new, in Android [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/) or more 
recently [Dagger2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) are well known examples (even some Kinject concepts are based on them). 

  Kinject has been thought to get the following objectives:
    * Ease to configure.  
    * Clean way to satisfy dependencies. 
    * High performance without lose flexibility.
    * Integration little intrusive and easily abstractable. 
    * Dependencies graph validation in compilation time. 
    * Based on code generation. 
    * [Proguard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/) friendly.

### Using Kinject

The flow is simple, **define your dependencies and inject them!**

* ***Defining dependencies***

    Use an ```@Provides``` annotated method to define a dependency. The method's return type define which dependency it satisfies.  
    For example, ```provideHeater()``` is invoked whenever a ```Heater``` is required:

    ```java
      @Provides
      public Heater provideHeater() {
        return new EletricalHeater();
      }
    ``` 

    Is possible for ```@Provides``` methods to have dependencies of their own. 

    ```java
      @Provides
      public Pump providePump(Heater heater) {
        return new Thermosiphon(heater);
      }
    ``` 

    All ```@Provides``` annotated methods must belong to a ```@Module``` annotated class.
   
     ```java
      @Module
      public class HeaterModule {

        @Provides
        public Heater provideHeater() {
          return new ElectricalHeater();
        }

      }
    ``` 

* ***Building the Graph***

  Before you can inject dependencies, you must define and load a *graph*. You can understand a *graph* as a set of injectables dependencies (defined by ```@Provides``` annotation) at the same time, linked to other dependencies.  
  In code, you have to set the graph root ```@Module``` annotation as ```completed = true ```.

  ```java
  @Module(completed = true)
  public class CoffeeMakerModule {
  }
  ``` 

  You can lean on ```@Includes``` annotation to define more flexible graphs. With ```@Includes``` you can define modules componses by other modules. Each dependency defined in the included module will be part of the final graph. 

  ```java
  @Module(completed = true)
  public class CoffeeMakerModule {

    @Includes
    public HeaterModule includeHeaterModule() {
      return new HeaterModule();
    }
   
  }
  ``` 

  An implementation of ```ModuleMapper``` (**Kinject** needs it to load the graph),
  will be generated by each *graph*. That is named as the graph root module ended with *Mapper*.
   
  ```java
  @Generated("com.wokdsem.kinject.codegen.CodeGen")
  public final class CoffeeMakerModuleMapper implements ModuleMapper {
      
    public static ModuleMapper from(CoffeeMakerModule coffeeMakerModule) {
    }
    
  }
  ```

  Now, you can initialize your injector and request dependencies. 

  ```java
  // Create injector
  ModuleMapper moduleMapper = CoffeeMakerModuleMapper.from(new CoffeeMakerModule());
  Kinject injector = Kinject.instantiate(moduleMapper);     

  // Injecting
  Heater heater = injector.get(Heater.class);
  ``` 

* ***Aditional features***

  * **Singleton** You can set ```singleton = true``` in ```@Provides``` annotation, so the injector instance will use a single instance of the dependency for all of its clients. 
 
  ```java
  @Provides(singleton = true)
  public Heater provideHeater() {
    return new ElectricalHeater();
  }
  ``` 

  * **Named** When the type isn't enought to identify a dependency, you can set ```named``` field in ```@Provides``` annotation. By default, all dependencies have an empty named value.
    
    Use ```Kinject.get(Class<T> tClass, String named)``` to inject a named dependency.
  ```java
  @Provides(named = "Application")
  public Context provideApplicationContext() {
    return appContext;
  }
  ``` 
      
### Compile-Time

* ***Validation*** 

    The Kinject annotation processor throws a compiler error if any graph has an invalid state. For example, this completed module doesn't know the ```Logger``` dependency.

  ```java
  @Module(completed = true)
  public class CoffeeMakerModule {
    
    @Provides
    public void CoffeeMaker provideCoffeeMaker(Logger logger) {
      return new LogCoffeeMaker(logger);
    }

  }
  ``` 

    When compiling it, ```javac``` rejects something like:

    ```
    [[ KINJECT : ERROR ]] Unknown dependency(Logger@) on @Provides(CoffeeMaker@) building graph(CoffeeMakerModule).
    ```

* ***Code Generation*** 

    Kinject annotation processor generates source files with names ended like ```*Adapter.java``` or ```*Mapper.java```. These files are Kinject implementation details and you shouldn't edit them. Maybe they are usefull when you are debugging an injection. 

### Proguard

* Kinject is Proguard friendly, you don't need to do anything. 

### Additional android notes

* Perhaps you would need to set up ``` android.compileOptions.incremental = false ```  in the app build file if you are having issues while compiling.

### Installation

* ***Status***
  * Release version: **1.2.2**

* ***Download***

  * You will need to include the `kinject-${kinject.version}.jar` in your application's runtime.

  * In order to activate code generation, you will need to include `kinject-compiler-${kinject.version].jar` in your build at compile time. 

  * In a gradle project, include the `kinject` artifact in the dependencies section of your `build.gradle` and the `kinject-compiler` artifact as `provided` dependency:  
      ```groovy
          dependencies {
            compile  'com.wokdsem.kinject:kinject:${kinject.version}'
            provided 'com.wokdsem.kinject:kinject-compiler:${kinject.version}'
          }
      ```
  * You can also find downloadable *.jar*s on jCenter.

You can first start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). \r\n\r\n* ***Why Kinject?***\r\n\r\n  Dependency injection frameworks are nothing new, in Android [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/) or more \r\nrecently [Dagger2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) are well known examples (even some Kinject concepts are based on them). \r\n\r\n  Kinject has been thought to get the following objectives:\r\n    * Ease to configure.  \r\n    * Clean way to satisfy dependencies. \r\n    * High performance without lose flexibility.\r\n    * Integration little intrusive and easily abstractable. \r\n    * Dependencies graph validation in compilation time. \r\n    * Based on code generation. \r\n    * [Proguard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/) friendly.\r\n\r\n### Using Kinject\r\n\r\nThe flow is simple, **define your dependencies and inject them!**\r\n\r\n* ***Defining dependencies***\r\n\r\n    Use an ```@Provides``` annotated method to define a dependency. The method's return type define which dependency it satisfies.  \r\n    For example, ```provideHeater()``` is invoked whenever a ```Heater``` is required:\r\n\r\n    ```java\r\n      @Provides\r\n      public Heater provideHeater() {\r\n        return new EletricalHeater();\r\n      }\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\n    Is possible for ```@Provides``` methods to have dependencies of their own. \r\n\r\n    ```java\r\n      @Provides\r\n      public Pump providePump(Heater heater) {\r\n        return new Thermosiphon(heater);\r\n      }\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\n    All ```@Provides``` annotated methods must belong to a ```@Module``` annotated class.\r\n   \r\n     ```java\r\n      @Module\r\n      public class HeaterModule {\r\n\r\n        @Provides\r\n        public Heater provideHeater() {\r\n          return new ElectricalHeater();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\n* ***Building the Graph***\r\n\r\n  Before you can inject dependencies, you must define and load a *graph*. You can understand a *graph* as a set of injectables dependencies (defined by ```@Provides``` annotation) at the same time, linked to other dependencies.  \r\n  In code, you have to set the graph root ```@Module``` annotation as ```completed = true ```.\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  @Module(completed = true)\r\n  public class CoffeeMakerModule {\r\n  }\r\n  ``` \r\n\r\n  You can lean on ```@Includes``` annotation to define more flexible graphs. With ```@Includes``` you can define modules componses by other modules. Each dependency defined in the included module will be part of the final graph. \r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  @Module(completed = true)\r\n  public class CoffeeMakerModule {\r\n\r\n    @Includes\r\n    public HeaterModule includeHeaterModule() {\r\n      return new HeaterModule();\r\n    }\r\n   \r\n  }\r\n  ``` \r\n\r\n  An implementation of ```ModuleMapper``` (**Kinject** needs it to load the graph),\r\n  will be generated by each *graph*. That is named as the graph root module suffixed with Mapper.\r\n   \r\n  ```java\r\n  @Generated(\"com.wokdsem.kinject.codegen.CodeGen\")\r\n  public final class CoffeeMakerModuleMapper implements ModuleMapper {\r\n      \r\n    public static ModuleMapper from(CoffeeMakerModule coffeeMakerModule) {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Now, you can initialize your injector and request dependencies. \r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  // Create injector\r\n  ModuleMapper moduleMapper = CoffeeMakerModuleMapper.from(new CoffeeMakerModule());\r\n  Kinject injector = Kinject.instantiate(moduleMapper);     \r\n\r\n  // Injecting\r\n  Heater heater = injector.get(Heater.class);\r\n  ``` \r\n\r\n* ***Aditional features***\r\n\r\n  * **Singleton** You can set ```singleton = true``` in ```@Provides``` annotation, so the injector instance will use a single instance of the dependency for all of its clients. \r\n \r\n  ```java\r\n  @Provides(singleton = true)\r\n  public Heater provideHeater() {\r\n    return new ElectricalHeater();\r\n  }\r\n  ``` \r\n\r\n  * **Named** When the type isn't enought to identify a dependency, you can set ```named``` field in ```@Provides``` annotation. By default, all dependencies have an empty named value.\r\n    \r\n    Use ```Kinject.get(Class<T> tClass, String named)``` to inject a named dependency.\r\n  ```java\r\n  @Provides(named = \"Application\")\r\n  public Context provideApplicationContext() {\r\n    return appContext;\r\n  }\r\n  ``` \r\n      \r\n### Compile-Time\r\n\r\n* ***Validation*** \r\n\r\n    The Kinject annotation processor throws a compiler error if any graph has an invalid state. For example, this completed module doesn't know the ```Logger``` dependency.\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  @Module(completed = true)\r\n  public class CoffeeMakerModule {\r\n    \r\n    @Provides\r\n    public void CoffeeMaker provideCoffeeMaker(Logger logger) {\r\n      return new LogCoffeeMaker(logger);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n  ``` \r\n\r\n    When compiling it, ```javac``` rejects something like:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [[ KINJECT : ERROR ]] Unknown dependency(Logger@) on @Provides(CoffeeMaker@) building graph(CoffeeMakerModule).\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* ***Code Generation*** \r\n\r\n    Kinject annotation processor generates source files with names ended like ```*Adapter.java``` or ```*Mapper.java```. These files are Kinject implementation details and you shouldn't use them, although they are usefull when you are debugging an injection. \r\n\r\n### Proguard\r\n\r\n* Kinject is Proguard friendly, you don't need to do anything. \r\n\r\n### Additional android notes\r\n\r\n* Perhaps you would need to set up ``` android.compileOptions.incremental = false ```  in the app build file if you are having issues while compiling.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n* ***Status***\r\n  * Release version: **1.2.0**\r\n\r\n* ***Download***\r\n\r\n  * You will need to include the `kinject-${kinject.version}.jar` in your application's runtime.\r\n\r\n  * In order to activate code generation, you will need to include `kinject-compiler-${kinject.version].jar` in your build at compile time. \r\n\r\n  * In a gradle project, include the `kinject` artifact in the dependencies section of your `build.gradle` and the `kinject-compiler` artifact as `provided` dependency:  \r\n      ```groovy\r\n          dependencies {\r\n            compile  'com.wokdsem.kinject:kinject:${kinject.version}'\r\n            provided 'com.wokdsem.kinject:kinject-compiler:${kinject.version}'\r\n          }\r\n      ```\r\n  * You can also find downloadable *.jar*s on jCenter.\r\n[Kinject](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/wokdsem/maven/com/wokdsem/kinject/kinject/1.2.0/kinject-1.2.0.jar) /\r\n[Kinject-Compiler](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/wokdsem/maven/com/wokdsem/kinject/kinject-compiler/1.2.0/kinject-compiler-1.2.0.jar).\r\n\r\n\r\n### License \r\n\r\n    Copyright 2016 Wokdsem\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.",

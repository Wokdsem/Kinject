{"name":"Kinject","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\nIf you donÂ´t know why dependency injection? You can first start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). \r\n\r\n* ***Why Kinject?***\r\n\r\n    Dependency injection frameworks are nothing new in java or android world, [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/) or more \r\nrecently [Dagger2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) are well knowns examples (even some Kinject concepts are based on them). \r\n\r\n* ***Kinject objectives***\r\n\r\n   * Ease to configure.  \r\n   * High performance without lose flexibility.\r\n   * Integration little intrusive and easily abstractable. \r\n   * Powerful clean way to satisfy dependencies.\r\n   * Dependencies graph validation in compilation time. \r\n   * Based on code generation. \r\n   * [Proguard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/) friendly.\r\n\r\n### Using Kinject\r\n\r\n### Proguard\r\n\r\n* Kinject is Proguard friendly, just add this sentence to proguard config:\r\n\r\n    ```java \r\n      -keep class kinject.Mapper\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n* ***Status***\r\n  * Release version: **x.x.x**\r\n\r\n* ***Download***\r\n\r\n  * You will need to include the `kinject-${kinject.version}.jar` in your application's runtime.\r\n\r\n  * In order to activate code generation, you will need to include `kinject-compiler-${kinject.version].jar` in your build at compile time. \r\n\r\n  * In a gradle project, include the `kinject` artifact in the dependencies section of your `build.gradle` and the `kinject-compiler` artifact as `provided` dependency:  \r\n      ```groovy\r\n          dependencies {\r\n            compile  'com.wokdsem.kinject:kinject:${kinject.version}'\r\n            provided 'com.wokdsem.kinject:kinject-compiler:${kinject.version}'\r\n          }\r\n      ```\r\n  * You can also find downloadable *.jars* on [jCenter.]()\r\n\r\n### License \r\n\r\n    Copyright 2016 Wokdsem\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
